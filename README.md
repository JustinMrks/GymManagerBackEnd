## Problems

Ability to transfer ownership of an account to another family member

Assigning members to a family group has to be done one by one

Putting an account on hold resets their monthly rate to $0

Upgrading/ downgrading accounts has to reset the entire membership and contract

Automatically shows all members, including deactivated members when looking somebody up

Clean User Interface, minimizing complexity

#### Minimum Clicks, Maximum Output
